# Age-and-Gender-Classification-using-CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying age and gender from facial images. It focuses on coupling the architectures for age and gender classification to take advantage of gender-specific age characteristics inherent to images / live cameras.
